## About
This is a minimal state immediate mode graphical user interface toolkit
written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple
embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies,
a default renderbackend or OS window and input handling but instead provides a very modular
library approach by using simple input state for input and draw
commands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a
layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and
render backends it only focuses on the actual UI.
## Highlights
- Graphical user interface toolkit
- Single header library
- Written in C89 (a.k.a. ANSI C or ISO C90)
- Small codebase (~18kLOC)
- Focus on portability, efficiency and simplicity
- No dependencies (not even the standard library if not wanted)
- Fully skinnable and customizable
- Low memory footprint with total memory control if needed or wanted
- UTF-8 support
- No global or hidden state
- Customizable library modules (you can compile and use only what you need)
- Optional font baker and vertex buffer output
## Features
- Absolutely no platform dependent code
- Memory management control ranging from/to
    - Ease of use by allocating everything from standard library
    - Control every byte of memory inside the library
- Font handling control ranging from/to
    - Use your own font implementation for everything
    - Use this libraries internal font baking and handling API
- Drawing output control ranging from/to
    - Simple shapes for more high level APIs which already have drawing capabilities
    - Hardware accessible anti-aliased vertex buffer output
- Customizable colors and properties ranging from/to
    - Simple changes to color by filling a simple color table
    - Complete control with ability to use skinning to decorate widgets
- Bendable UI library with widget ranging from/to
    - Basic widgets like buttons, checkboxes, slider, ...
    - Advanced widget like abstract comboboxes, contextual menus,...
- Compile time configuration to only compile what you need
    - Subset which can be used if you do not want to link or use the standard library
- Can be easily modified to only update on user input instead of frame updates
## Usage
This library is self contained in one single header file and can be used either
in header only mode or in implementation mode. The header only mode is used
by default when included and allows including this header in other headers
and does not contain the actual implementation. <br /><br />
The implementation mode requires to define  the preprocessor macro
NK_IMPLEMENTATION in *one* .c/.cpp file before #includeing this file, e.g.:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
    #define NK_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "nuklear.h"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Also optionally define the symbols listed in the section "OPTIONAL DEFINES"
below in header and implementation mode if you want to use additional functionality
or need more control over the library.
!!! WARNING
    Every time nuklear is included define the same compiler flags. This very important not doing so could lead to compiler errors or even worse stack corruptions.
### Flags
Flag                            | Description
--------------------------------|------------------------------------------
NK_PRIVATE                      | If defined declares all functions as static, so they can only be accessed inside the file that contains the implementation
NK_INCLUDE_FIXED_TYPES          | If defined it will include header `<stdint.h>` for fixed sized types otherwise nuklear tries to select the correct type. If that fails it will throw a compiler error and you have to select the correct types yourself.
NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR    | if defined it will include header `<stdlib.h>` and provide additional functions to use this library without caring for memory allocation control and therefore ease memory management.
NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_IO          | if defined it will include header `<stdio.h>` and provide additional functions depending on file loading.
NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS     | if defined it will include header <stdio.h> and provide additional functions depending on file loading.
NK_INCLUDE_VERTEX_BUFFER_OUTPUT | Defining this adds a vertex draw command list backend to this library, which allows you to convert queue commands into vertex draw commands. This is mainly if you need a hardware accessible format for OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, Metal,...
NK_INCLUDE_FONT_BAKING          | Defining this adds `stb_truetype` and `stb_rect_pack` implementation to this library and provides font baking and rendering. If you already have font handling or do not want to use this font handler you don't have to define it.
NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_FONT         | Defining this adds the default font: ProggyClean.ttf into this library which can be loaded into a font atlas and allows using this library without having a truetype font
NK_INCLUDE_COMMAND_USERDATA     | Defining this adds a userdata pointer into each command. Can be useful for example if you want to provide custom shaders depending on the used widget. Can be combined with the style structures.
NK_BUTTON_TRIGGER_ON_RELEASE    |  Different platforms require button clicks occurring either on buttons being pressed (up to down) or released (down to up). By default this library will react on buttons being pressed, but if you define this it will only trigger if a button is released.
NK_ZERO_COMMAND_MEMORY          | Defining this will zero out memory for each drawing command added to a drawing queue (inside nk_command_buffer_push). Zeroing command memory is very useful for fast checking (using memcmp) if command buffers are equal and avoid drawing frames when nothing on screen has changed since previous frame.
!!! WARNING
    The following flags will pull in the standard C library:
    - NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR
    - NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_IO
    - NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS
!!! WARNING
    The following flags if defined need to be defined for both header and implementation:
    - NK_INCLUDE_FIXED_TYPES
    - NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR
    - NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS
    - NK_INCLUDE_VERTEX_BUFFER_OUTPUT
    - NK_INCLUDE_FONT_BAKING
    - NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_FONT
    - NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS
    - NK_INCLUDE_COMMAND_USERDATA
### Constants
Define                          | Description
--------------------------------|---------------------------------------
NK_BUFFER_DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE  | Initial buffer size allocated by all buffers while using the default allocator functions included by defining NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR. If you don't want to allocate the default 4k memory then redefine it.
NK_MAX_NUMBER_BUFFER            | Maximum buffer size for the conversion buffer between float and string Under normal circumstances this should be more than sufficient.
NK_INPUT_MAX                    | Defines the max number of bytes which can be added as text input in one frame. Under normal circumstances this should be more than sufficient.
!!! WARNING
    The following constants if defined need to be defined for both header and implementation:
    - NK_MAX_NUMBER_BUFFER
    - NK_BUFFER_DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE
    - NK_INPUT_MAX
### Dependencies
Function    | Description
------------|-------------
NK_ASSERT   | If you don't define this, nuklear will use <assert.h> with assert().
NK_MEMSET   | You can define this to 'memset' or your own memset implementation replacement. If not nuklear will use its own version.
NK_MEMCPY   | You can define this to 'memcpy' or your own memcpy implementation replacement. If not nuklear will use its own version.
NK_SQRT     | You can define this to 'sqrt' or your own sqrt implementation replacement. If not nuklear will use its own slow and not highly accurate version.
NK_SIN      | You can define this to 'sinf' or your own sine implementation replacement. If not nuklear will use its own approximation implementation.
NK_COS      | You can define this to 'cosf' or your own cosine implementation replacement. If not nuklear will use its own approximation implementation.
NK_STRTOD   | You can define this to `strtod` or your own string to double conversion implementation replacement. If not defined nuklear will use its own imprecise and possibly unsafe version (does not handle nan or infinity!).
NK_DTOA     | You can define this to `dtoa` or your own double to string conversion implementation replacement. If not defined nuklear will use its own imprecise and possibly unsafe version (does not handle nan or infinity!).
NK_VSNPRINTF| If you define `NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS` as well as `NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_IO` and want to be safe define this to `vsnprintf` on compilers supporting later versions of C or C++. By default nuklear will check for your stdlib version in C as well as compiler version in C++. if `vsnprintf` is available it will define it to `vsnprintf` directly. If not defined and if you have older versions of C or C++ it will be defined to `vsprintf` which is unsafe.
!!! WARNING
    The following dependencies will pull in the standard C library if not redefined:
    - NK_ASSERT
!!! WARNING
    The following dependencies if defined need to be defined for both header and implementation:
    - NK_ASSERT
!!! WARNING

## API
### Context
Contexts are the main entry point and the majestro of nuklear and contain all required state.
They are used for window, memory, input, style, stack, commands and time management and need
to be passed into all nuklear GUI specific functions.
#### Usage
To use a context it first has to be initialized which can be achieved by calling
one of either `nk_init_default`, `nk_init_fixed`, `nk_init`, `nk_init_custom`.
Each takes in a font handle and a specific way of handling memory. Memory control
hereby ranges from standard library to just specifying a fixed sized block of memory
which nuklear has to manage itself from.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c
struct nk_context ctx;
nk_init_xxx(&ctx, ...);
while (1) {
    // [...]
    nk_clear(&ctx);
}
nk_free(&ctx);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#### Reference
Function            | Description
--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
__nk_init_default__ | Initializes context with standard library memory allocation (malloc,free)
__nk_init_fixed__   | Initializes context from single fixed size memory block
__nk_init__         | Initializes context with memory allocator callbacks for alloc and free
__nk_init_custom__  | Initializes context from two buffers. One for draw commands the other for window/panel/table allocations
__nk_clear__        | Called at the end of the frame to reset and prepare the context for the next frame
__nk_free__         | Shutdown and free all memory allocated inside the context
__nk_set_user_data__| Utility function to pass user data to draw command
#### nk_init_default
Initializes a `nk_context` struct with a default standard library allocator.
Should be used if you don't want to be bothered with memory management in nuklear.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c
NK_API int nk_init_default(struct nk_context *ctx, const struct nk_user_font *font);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameter   | Description
------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
__ctx__     | Must point to an either stack or heap allocated `nk_context` struct
__font__    | Must point to a previously initialized font handle for more info look at font documentation
Returns either `false(0)` on failure or `true(1)` on success.
#### nk_init_fixed
Initializes a `nk_context` struct from single fixed size memory block
Should be used if you want complete control over nuklear's memory management.
Especially recommended for system with little memory or systems with virtual memory.
For the later case you can just allocate for example 16MB of virtual memory
and only the required amount of memory will actually be committed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c
NK_API int nk_init_fixed(struct nk_context *ctx, void *memory, nk_size size, const struct nk_user_font *font);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!!! Warning
    make sure the passed memory block is aligned correctly for `nk_draw_commands`.

Returns either `false(0)` on failure or `true(1)` on success.
#### nk_init
Initializes a `nk_context` struct with memory allocation callbacks for nuklear to allocate
memory from. Used internally for `nk_init_default` and provides a kitchen sink allocation
interface to nuklear. Can be useful for cases like monitoring memory consumption.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameter   | Description
------------|-----------------------------------------------------------

------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
__ctx__     | Must point to a previously initialized `nk_context` struct
__data__    | Handle with either pointer or index to be passed into every draw commands
### Input
The input API is responsible for holding the current input state composed of
mouse, key and text input states.
It is worth noting that no direct os or window handling is done in nuklear.
Instead all input state has to be provided by platform specific code. This in one hand
expects more work from the user and complicates usage but on the other hand
provides simple abstraction over a big number of platforms, libraries and other
already provided functionality.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c
nk_input_begin(&ctx);
while (GetEvent(&evt)) {
    if (evt.type == MOUSE_MOVE)
        nk_input_motion(&ctx, evt.motion.x, evt.motion.y);
    else if (evt.type == [...]) {
        // [...]
    }
} nk_input_end(&ctx);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#### Usage
Input state needs to be provided to nuklear by first calling `nk_input_begin`
which resets internal state like delta mouse position and button transistions.
After `nk_input_begin` all current input state needs to be provided. This includes
mouse motion, button and key pressed and released, text input and scrolling.
Both event- or state-based input handling are supported by this API
and should work without problems. Finally after all input state has been
mirrored `nk_input_end` needs to be called to finish input process.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c
struct nk_context ctx;
nk_init_xxx(&ctx, ...);
while (1) {
    Event evt;
    nk_input_begin(&ctx);
    while (GetEvent(&evt)) {
        if (evt.type == MOUSE_MOVE)
            nk_input_motion(&ctx, evt.motion.x, evt.motion.y);
        else if (evt.type == [...]) {
            // [...]
        }
    }
    nk_input_end(&ctx);
    // [...]
    nk_clear(&ctx);
} nk_free(&ctx);

                       Color pickers now use floating point values to represent
                       HSV values. To get back the old behavior I added some additional
                       color conversion functions to cast between nk_color and
                       nk_colorf.

- 2017/09/14 (2.00.0) - BREAKING CHANGE: Modifing window position and size funtions now
                       require the name of the window and must happen outside the window
                       building process (between function call nk_begin and nk_end).
- 2017/09/11 (1.40.9) - Fixed window background flag if background window is declared last

- 2017/06/30 (1.40.1) - Fixed drawing lines smaller or equal zero
- 2017/06/08 (1.40.0) - Removed the breaking part of last commit. Auto layout now only
                       comes in effect if you pass in zero was row height argument
- 2017/06/08 (1.40.0) - BREAKING CHANGE: while not directly API breaking it will change
                       how layouting works. From now there will be an internal minimum
                       row height derived from font height. If you need a row smaller than
                       that you can directly set it by `nk_layout_set_min_row_height` and
                       reset the value back by calling `nk_layout_reset_min_row_height.

- 2017/01/13 (1.32.0) - Added flag to put scaler into the bottom left corner
- 2017/01/13 (1.31.0) - Added additional row layouting method to combine both
                       dynamic and static widgets.
- 2016/12/31 (1.30.0) - Extended scrollbar offset from 16-bit to 32-bit
- 2016/12/31 (1.29.2)- Fixed closing window bug of minimized windows
- 2016/12/03 (1.29.1)- Fixed wrapped text with no seperator and C89 error
- 2016/12/03 (1.29.0) - Changed text wrapping to process words not characters

- 2016/11/19 (1.28.3)- Fixed memory leak caused by popup repeated closing
- 2016/11/18 (1.28.2)- Fixed memory leak caused by popup panel allocation
- 2016/11/10 (1.28.1)- Fixed some warnings and C++ error
- 2016/11/10 (1.28.0)- Added additional `nk_button` versions which allows to directly
                       pass in a style struct to change buttons visual.
- 2016/11/10 (1.27.0)- Added additional 'nk_tree' versions to support external state
                       storage. Just like last the `nk_group` commit the main
                       advantage is that you optionally can minimize nuklears runtime
                       memory consumption or handle hash collisions.
- 2016/11/09 (1.26.0)- Added additional `nk_group` version to support external scrollbar
                       offset storage. Main advantage is that you can externalize
                       the memory management for the offset. It could also be helpful
                       if you have a hash collision in `nk_group_begin` but really
                       want the name. In addition I added `nk_list_view` which allows
                       to draw big lists inside a group without actually having to
                       commit the whole list to nuklear (issue #269).
- 2016/10/30 (1.25.1)- Fixed clipping rectangle bug inside `nk_draw_list`
- 2016/10/29 (1.25.0)- Pulled `nk_panel` memory management into nuklear and out of
                       the hands of the user. From now on users don't have to care
                       about panels unless they care about some information. If you
                       still need the panel just call `nk_window_get_panel`.
- 2016/10/21 (1.24.0)- Changed widget border drawing to stroked rectangle from filled
                       rectangle for less overdraw and widget background transparency.
- 2016/10/18 (1.23.0)- Added `nk_edit_focus` for manually edit widget focus control
- 2016/09/29 (1.22.7)- Fixed deduction of basic type in non `<stdint.h>` compilation
- 2016/09/29 (1.22.6)- Fixed edit widget UTF-8 text cursor drawing bug
- 2016/09/28 (1.22.5)- Fixed edit widget UTF-8 text appending/inserting/removing
- 2016/09/28 (1.22.4)- Fixed drawing bug inside edit widgets which offset all text
                       text in every edit widget if one of them is scrolled.
- 2016/09/28 (1.22.3)- Fixed small bug in edit widgets if not active. The wrong
                       text length is passed. It should have been in bytes but
                       was passed as glyphes.
- 2016/09/20 (1.22.2)- Fixed color button size calculation
- 2016/09/20 (1.22.1)- Fixed some `nk_vsnprintf` behavior bugs and removed
                       `<stdio.h>` again from `NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS`.
- 2016/09/18 (1.22.0)- C89 does not support vsnprintf only C99 and newer as well
                       as C++11 and newer. In addition to use vsnprintf you have
                       to include <stdio.h>. So just defining `NK_INCLUDE_STD_VAR_ARGS`
                       is not enough. That behavior is now fixed. By default if
                       both varargs as well as stdio is selected I try to use
                       vsnprintf if not possible I will revert to vsprintf. If
                       varargs but not stdio was defined I will use my own function.
- 2016/09/15 (1.21.2)- Fixed panel `close` behavior for deeper panel levels
- 2016/09/15 (1.21.1)- Fixed C++ errors and wrong argument to `nk_panel_get_xxxx`
- 2016/09/13 (1.21.0) - !BREAKING! Fixed nonblocking popup behavior in menu, combo,
                       and contextual which prevented closing in y-direction if
                       popup did not reach max height.
                       In addition the height parameter was changed into vec2
                       for width and height to have more control over the popup size.
- 2016/09/13 (1.20.3) - Cleaned up and extended type selection
- 2016/09/13 (1.20.2)- Fixed slider behavior hopefully for the last time. This time
                       all calculation are correct so no more hackery.
- 2016/09/13 (1.20.1)- Internal change to divide window/panel flags into panel flags and types.
                       Suprisinly spend years in C and still happened to confuse types
                       with flags. Probably something to take note.
- 2016/09/08 (1.20.0)- Added additional helper function to make it easier to just
                       take the produced buffers from `nk_convert` and unplug the
                       iteration process from `nk_context`. So now you can
                       just use the vertex,element and command buffer + two pointer
                       inside the command buffer retrieved by calls `nk__draw_begin`
                       and `nk__draw_end` and macro `nk_draw_foreach_bounded`.
- 2016/09/08 (1.19.0)- Added additional asserts to make sure every `nk_xxx_begin` call
                       for windows, popups, combobox, menu and contextual is guarded by
                       `if` condition and does not produce false drawing output.
- 2016/09/08 (1.18.0)- Changed confusing name for `NK_SYMBOL_RECT_FILLED`, `NK_SYMBOL_RECT`
                       to hopefully easier to understand `NK_SYMBOL_RECT_FILLED` and
                       `NK_SYMBOL_RECT_OUTLINE`.
- 2016/09/08 (1.17.0)- Changed confusing name for `NK_SYMBOL_CIRLCE_FILLED`, `NK_SYMBOL_CIRCLE`
                       to hopefully easier to understand `NK_SYMBOL_CIRCLE_FILLED` and
                       `NK_SYMBOL_CIRCLE_OUTLINE`.
- 2016/09/08 (1.16.0)- Added additional checks to select correct types if `NK_INCLUDE_FIXED_TYPES`
                       is not defined by supporting the biggest compiler GCC, clang and MSVC.
- 2016/09/07 (1.15.3)- Fixed `NK_INCLUDE_COMMAND_USERDATA` define to not cause an error
- 2016/09/04 (1.15.2)- Fixed wrong combobox height calculation
- 2016/09/03 (1.15.1)- Fixed gaps inside combo boxes in OpenGL
- 2016/09/02 (1.15.0) - Changed nuklear to not have any default vertex layout and
                       instead made it user provided. The range of types to convert
                       to is quite limited at the moment, but I would be more than
                       happy to accept PRs to add additional.
- 2016/08/30 (1.14.2) - Removed unused variables
- 2016/08/30 (1.14.1) - Fixed C++ build errors
- 2016/08/30 (1.14.0) - Removed mouse dragging from SDL demo since it does not work correctly
- 2016/08/30 (1.13.4) - Tweaked some default styling variables
- 2016/08/30 (1.13.3) - Hopefully fixed drawing bug in slider, in general I would
                       refrain from using slider with a big number of steps.
- 2016/08/30 (1.13.2) - Fixed close and minimize button which would fire even if the
                       window was in Read Only Mode.
- 2016/08/30 (1.13.1) - Fixed popup panel padding handling which was previously just
                       a hack for combo box and menu.
- 2016/08/30 (1.13.0) - Removed `NK_WINDOW_DYNAMIC` flag from public API since
                       it is bugged and causes issues in window selection.
- 2016/08/30 (1.12.0) - Removed scaler size. The size of the scaler is now
                       determined by the scrollbar size
- 2016/08/30 (1.11.2) - Fixed some drawing bugs caused by changes from 1.11
- 2016/08/30 (1.11.1) - Fixed overlapping minimized window selection
- 2016/08/30 (1.11.0) - Removed some internal complexity and overly complex code
                       handling panel padding and panel border.
- 2016/08/29 (1.10.0) - Added additional height parameter to `nk_combobox_xxx`

- 2016/08/29 (1.10.0) - Added experimental mouse scrolling to popups, menus and comboboxes
- 2016/08/26 (1.10.0) - Added window name string prepresentation to account for
                       hash collisions. Currently limited to NK_WINDOW_MAX_NAME
                       which in term can be redefined if not big enough.
- 2016/08/26 (1.10.0) - Added stacks for temporary style/UI changes in code
- 2016/08/25 (1.10.0) - Changed `nk_input_is_key_pressed` and 'nk_input_is_key_released'
                       to account for key press and release happening in one frame.
- 2016/08/25 (1.10.0) - Added additional nk_edit flag to directly jump to the end on activate
- 2016/08/17 (1.09.6)- Removed invalid check for value zero in nk_propertyx
- 2016/08/16 (1.09.5)- Fixed ROM mode for deeper levels of popup windows parents.
- 2016/08/15 (1.09.4)- Editbox are now still active if enter was pressed with flag
                       `NK_EDIT_SIG_ENTER`. Main reasoning is to be able to keep
                       typing after commiting.
- 2016/08/15 (1.09.4)- Removed redundant code
- 2016/08/15 (1.09.4)- Fixed negative numbers in `nk_strtoi` and remove unused variable
- 2016/08/15 (1.09.3)- Fixed `NK_WINDOW_BACKGROUND` flag behavior to select a background
                       window only as selected by hovering and not by clicking.
- 2016/08/14 (1.09.2)- Fixed a bug in font atlas which caused wrong loading
                       of glyphes for font with multiple ranges.
- 2016/08/12 (1.09.1)- Added additional function to check if window is currently
                       hidden and therefore not visible.
- 2016/08/12 (1.09.1)- nk_window_is_closed now queries the correct flag `NK_WINDOW_CLOSED`
                       instead of the old flag `NK_WINDOW_HIDDEN`
- 2016/08/09 (1.09.0) - Added additional double version to nk_property and changed
                       the underlying implementation to not cast to float and instead
                       work directly on the given values.
- 2016/08/09 (1.08.0) - Added additional define to overwrite library internal
                       floating pointer number to string conversion for additional
                       precision.
- 2016/08/09 (1.08.0) - Added additional define to overwrite library internal
                       string to floating point number conversion for additional
                       precision.
- 2016/08/08 (1.07.2)- Fixed compiling error without define NK_INCLUDE_FIXED_TYPE
- 2016/08/08 (1.07.1)- Fixed possible floating point error inside `nk_widget` leading
                       to wrong wiget width calculation which results in widgets falsly
                       becomming tagged as not inside window and cannot be accessed.
- 2016/08/08 (1.07.0) - Nuklear now differentiates between hiding a window (NK_WINDOW_HIDDEN) and
                       closing a window (NK_WINDOW_CLOSED). A window can be hidden/shown
                       by using `nk_window_show` and closed by either clicking the close
                       icon in a window or by calling `nk_window_close`. Only closed
                       windows get removed at the end of the frame while hidden windows
                       remain.
- 2016/08/08 (1.06.0) - Added `nk_edit_string_zero_terminated` as a second option to
                       `nk_edit_string` which takes, edits and outputs a '\0' terminated string.
- 2016/08/08 (1.05.4)- Fixed scrollbar auto hiding behavior
- 2016/08/08 (1.05.3)- Fixed wrong panel padding selection in `nk_layout_widget_space`
- 2016/08/07 (1.05.2)- Fixed old bug in dynamic immediate mode layout API, calculating
                       wrong item spacing and panel width.
                       define NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS to allow more fine
                       grained controlled over library includes.
- 2016/08/06 (1.04.5)- Changed memset calls to NK_MEMSET
- 2016/08/04 (1.04.4)- Fixed fast window scaling behavior
- 2016/08/04 (1.04.3)- Fixed window scaling, movement bug which appears if you
                       move/scale a window and another window is behind it.
                       If you are fast enough then the window behind gets activated
                       and the operation is blocked. I now require activating
                       by hovering only if mouse is not pressed.
- 2016/08/04 (1.04.2)- Fixed changing fonts
- 2016/08/03 (1.04.1)- Fixed `NK_WINDOW_BACKGROUND` behavior
- 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added color parameter to `nk_draw_image`
- 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added additional window padding style attributes for
                       sub windows (combo, menu, ...)
- 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added functions to show/hide software cursor
- 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added `NK_WINDOW_BACKGROUND` flag to force a window
                       to be always in the background of the screen
- 2016/08/03 (1.03.2)- Removed invalid assert macro for NK_RGB color picker
- 2016/08/01 (1.03.1)- Added helper macros into header include guard
- 2016/07/29 (1.03.0) - Moved the window/table pool into the header part to
                       simplify memory management by removing the need to
                       allocate the pool.
- 2016/07/29 (1.02.0) - Added auto scrollbar hiding window flag which if enabled
                       will hide the window scrollbar after NK_SCROLLBAR_HIDING_TIMEOUT
                       seconds without window interaction. To make it work
                       you have to also set a delta time inside the `nk_context`.
- 2016/07/25 (1.01.1) - Fixed small panel and panel border drawing bugs
- 2016/07/15 (1.01.0) - Added software cursor to `nk_style` and `nk_context`
- 2016/07/15 (1.01.0) - Added const correctness to `nk_buffer_push' data argument
- 2016/07/15 (1.01.0) - Removed internal font baking API and simplified
                       font atlas memory management by converting pointer
                       arrays for fonts and font configurations to lists.
- 2016/07/15 (1.00.0) - Changed button API to use context dependend button
                       behavior instead of passing it for every function call.
